      Dougger the Pugger<br>
      Woof woof<br>
      It's me, Doug!<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Doug The Pug is a legend. He saves lives everyday with his overly charming snout and wheezy smile. The point of this game is to live like Doug. Take naps and eat treats, the way life should be lived.

      This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY7m5jjJ9mM" target="_blank">video</a> shows cats, which are clearly way worse thsan dogs because they are cats. Honestly, people need to stop buying small lions and start adopting more dogs.
